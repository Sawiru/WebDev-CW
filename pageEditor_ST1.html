                    <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                        <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                            <p>This page serves as an introductory splash screen, providing a brief introduction before automatically redirecting the user to the main homepage after 4 seconds.
                               It sets the visual tone for the website, providing users with an engaging first impression. The centered layout provides a balanced and visually appealing view, making 
                               the content easy to read. height: 100vh; Ensures the splash screen takes up the full height of the viewport, creating a full-screen effect for the introduction and the warm orange color used for headings and the 
                               gradient background color evoke feelings of warmth which ties in perfectly with the theme of Zero Hunger. Class "content-wrapper"  container wraps all content, applying max-width, padding, and a background gradient, ensuring the content doesn't stretch too far across wide screens while
                               maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design. Class "loading-container" Holds the spinner animation, giving users a visual cue that the page is loading and they should wait for the redirection. 
                               The Montserrat font keeps the design consistent, readable, and modern.The loading animation helps users understand that the page is being processed, improving user experience. By using an external CSS file, updates
                               and maintenance are easier. The spinner is created using CSS properties like border-top and border-radius to form a circular spinning effect and @keyframes spin defines the continuous rotation of the spinner to give it a smooth
                               animation. </p> 
                        
                        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                            <p>The splash page uses several accessibility features to ensure an inclusive experience. It employs semantic HTML, such as h1, h2, and p tags, for proper content structure and readability. The background and 
                               text offer sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments, while alt text for images ensures screen readers can describe the content.</p>

                            <p>The Content Page is designed for clear and engaging information presentation, utilizing a structured multi-section layout. It uses elements such as (section, aside, and figure) to improve content organization.

                                  at the top, enabling users to quickly access the main content. Headings follow a logical hierarchy (h1, followed by h2, h3, etc.), ensuring better readability. A "Go to Top" button is included for easier page navigation.

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                        <p>During the process, one of the main challenges encountered was maintaining consistency across all pages, as various team members worked on different sections. To ensure the design stays the same, navigation, and styling, we shared a global CSS
                           file which was essential. Additionally while I made sure to use semantic HTML and added appropriate attributes, there were some interactive elements that didn’t behave as expected. For instance, custom buttons with icons were not fully accessible
                           to screen readers. I also had to fine-tune the navigation parts. This was especially important for the dropdown and button controls. Additionally, integrating the
                           dynamic JavaScript interactions like the expandable reviews required ensuring that the page remained usable and accessible when content changed. Lessons learned from these challenges was the importance
                           of thorough testing across devices and browsers and to keep the work organized especially because you're sharing with your team mates aswell. Additionally, while implementing modern design trends, one must not overlook the core principles of accessibility and compatibility, especially when designing for a wide
                           range of users. Testing early and often was essential in identifying issues before they became blockers.</p>
