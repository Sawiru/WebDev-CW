            <section>
                <h2 id="home">Home page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Home Page serves as the main entry point for the website and sets the visual and structural foundation. The page is designed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean, structured, and responsive layout. 
                    The navigation bar is implemented using an unordered list and styled with CSS to provide hover effects and visual feedback on active links. 
                    The page layout follows a structured <code>div</code> container model with a dedicated <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, and <code>footer</code> section, ensuring a logical content flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interactive elements such as buttons and hyperlinks are styled with CSS transitions to improve user experience.
                    The homepage also includes an introductory section with an eye-catching heading, a brief description of the project's mission, and interactive tiles linking to different content sections.
                    These tiles employ CSS animations, such as hover effects and box shadows, to enhance usability and engagement.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The Home Page is designed with accessibility in mind, following guidelines given. Alternative text (<code>alt</code>) is provided for images, ensuring that screen readers can interpret visual content.
                    Proper contrast ratios between text and background are maintained for readability. The navigation bar is fully keyboard-accessible, allowing users to tab through links effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Font sizes are defined in relative units (<code>rem</code> and <code>em</code>) to support text resizing for users with visual impairments.
                    A <strong>"Go to Top"</strong> button is included, making navigation easier for users browsing long pages.
                </p>
                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->

            <section>
                <h2 id="table">Table</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Table Page features a <strong>structured and interactive table</strong> presenting relevant data in an easy-to-read format.
                    The table is built using the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, incorporating <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> to ensure a clear and structured hierarchy.
                    Column headers (<code>&lt;th&gt;</code>) are styled with CSS to make them visually distinct, while alternating row colors (<code>nth-child</code> CSS selector) improve readability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Icons are used within the table cells to visually represent key data points. 
                    The <strong>hover effects</strong> on rows provide a subtle interaction cue, improving user engagement.
                    A <strong>scrollable table wrapper</strong> is implemented to handle large datasets without breaking the layout.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Each table cell has a meaningful label, and tooltip descriptions (<code>title</code> attribute) are added to provide additional information when hovered over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For better contrast, table rows use <strong>alternating colors</strong>, and <strong>high-contrast borders</strong> help distinguish content effectively.
                    Additionally, <strong>zoom support</strong> is tested to ensure users with visual impairments can easily enlarge content without breaking the page layout.
                </p>
                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->

                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Content Page is structured to present detailed information in an engaging and readable manner.
                    It utilizes a <strong>multi-section layout</strong>, incorporating HTML elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, for better content organization.
                    Internal linking is implemented through <strong>anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) elements with IDs</strong>, allowing users to navigate to specific sections without reloading the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is used to create a well-structured layout with <strong>consistent typography</strong> and <strong>spacing</strong>. 
                    The page also features an interactive content navigation menu that remains fixed (<code>position: fixed</code>) to enhance usability.
                    Interactive elements such as images, icons, and buttons are styled with CSS hover effects, transitions, and shadow properties to provide a modern look and feel.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    To enhance accessibility, all <strong>images</strong> and <strong>icons</strong> have appropriate <strong>alt text</strong>.
                    The page uses <strong>semantic HTML elements</strong>, making it easier for screen readers to interpret the content structure.
                    For navigation, a <strong>skip link</strong> is implemented at the top of the page, allowing users to jump directly to the main content.
                    Internal links are accompanied by <strong>ARIA labels</strong> where necessary to improve usability for assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Headings are structured in a logical hierarchy (<code>h1</code> followed by <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, etc.), improving readability.
                    The <strong>"Go to Top"</strong> button is included to aid navigation.
                    Additionally, content sections have sufficient <strong>line height</strong> and <strong>padding</strong>, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for all users.
                </p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    During the development of the website, several challenges arose, requiring problem-solving and adaptation. 
                    One of the primary difficulties was ensuring <strong>consistency across all web pages</strong>, as different team 
                    members were responsible for different sections. Maintaining a uniform design, navigation, and styling required 
                    effective communication and adherence to a <strong>global CSS file</strong>. Additionally, implementing 
                    <strong>responsive design</strong> posed a challenge, particularly in ensuring that elements adapted correctly 
                    across different screen sizes without breaking the layout. Another hurdle was validating all pages to comply with 
                    <strong>HTML and CSS standards</strong>, as minor syntax errors or incorrect attribute usage led to unexpected display issues.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Through these challenges, we learned the importance of <strong>collaboration and version control</strong>, as 
                    sharing code and making consistent updates required clear communication and structured file management. 
                    We also gained valuable experience in <strong>web accessibility</strong>, 
                    keyboard navigation, and proper contrast ratios contribute to an inclusive user experience. 
                    Troubleshooting validation errors improved our <strong>attention to detail</strong>, reinforcing the necessity 
                    of writing clean and structured code. Overall, the project strengthened our skills in 
                    <strong>HTML, CSS, and responsive design</strong>, while also highlighting the significance of teamwork in web development.

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>
                        The pages I have created are compliant with Janet regulations governing web page publication. This includes ensuring that all pages are validated for HTML and CSS standards,
                        and that accessibility guidelines are followed. The pages are designed to be inclusive, with proper alt attributes for images, keyboard navigation, and optimized color contrast. 
                        The content is original and relevant to the theme of Zero Hunger, and all external resources are properly referenced.
